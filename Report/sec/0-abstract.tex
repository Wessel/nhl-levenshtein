This report will compare three different programming languages in performance and readability.
Each programming language will implement a different programming paradigm.

Haskell was used as functional language, C\# as imperative language,
and TypeScript as semi-functional language.

The Levenshtein distance algorithm, which measures string similarity,
was implemented in each language to evaluate performance and readability.

Standardized unit tests and benchmarking tools (Criterion, BenchmarkDotNet, Deno Bench)
have been used to compare each implementation.

Results revealed significant performance differences.
C\# outperformed both TypeScript and Haskell, executing tasks up to $1000 \times$ faster in
long-string comparisons. Haskell, while slower, demonstrated way better resource
efficiency, using $2 \times$ less memory compared to C\# and TypeScript.

These results highlight the trade-offs between execution speed and resource usage.
